# Introducing TabKeeper: Simplify Your Workflow

Are you tired of the daily grind of opening and closing the same tabs for your work or studies? You know the routine: open 2-3 tabs, work on them, close the browser, and repeat the process the next day. But what happens when you need to revisit those tabs? Bookmarking might seem like a solution, but it falls short when you're constantly updating tab URLs.

# Break the Cycle with TabKeeper

That's why I created TabKeeper, a browser extension that lets you group multiple tabs together and keep them in sync. With TabKeeper, you can:

- Open your favorite tabs with just one click
- Automatically update tab URLs, so you always have the latest information
- Simplify your workflow and reduce distractions
