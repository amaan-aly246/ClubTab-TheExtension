# What this extension does
### You open 2-3 tabs for your academic/non-academic work. When you are done with the work for that day, you close your browser. The next day, you open the same tabs and repeat the same process.
### You think about bookmarking the following tabs to solve the problem of finding them again, but bookmarking is of no use if you keep updating the tab URLs.
### To solve this problem, I created ClubTab, an extension that lets you group multiple tabs together. This allows you to open those tabs with just one click, and not only that, it keeps them in sync with any changes.
